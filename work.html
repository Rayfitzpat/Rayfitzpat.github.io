      <i><strong>Ericsson Athlone 8 month college placement</strong></i>
      <br>
      This was my goal when I started my course, I wanted to experience a tech company for an extended period and I certainly got that experience with 8 months spent in Ericsson from 
      january to August 2022.  I had a new team this time and a lot was expected of me.  I worked in a complex area called modelling, where models define how applications 
      behave in ENM.  Invaluable experience was gained here working on production code, creating and completing stories, tasks, improvements and spikes. I also got to deal with support tickets and 
      delved into how ENM's architecture layers work.
      Additionaly I gained experience working with physical, virtual and cloud servers to test code.  This really enhanced my knowledge of linux and bash scripting.
      <br>
      Towards the end of my placement, I had the oppertunity to work with the INFUSE (investing in future software engineers) program.  This was a month long program that
      saw myself and some colleagues teach Java, Android studio, agile and GitHub to 14 students aged 16-18. A hugely rewarding experience that ignited a passion for teaching and sharing 
      my knowledge of code. This trial program was a great success and will now be carried out 3 times per year going forward.

      <i><strong>Ericsson Athlone 3 month internship</strong></i>
      <br>
     Upon finishing my 2nd year at TUS I again interviewed with Ericsson for another 3 months internship.  This time I felt like I could contribute a lot more to the team as my knowledge had increased in 
     areas such as Java and Javascript.  This certainly helped me to adapt to my new team quickly and I was able to complete more tasks and stories given to me.
     I got to learn a lot more about ENM, Ericsson's Network Management system and even got to add some small features to it.
     I also gained experience working with virtual machines, linux and testing on virtual servers.

    <div> 
      <i><strong>Ericsson Athlone 3 month internship</strong></i>
      <br>
      After finishing first year in TUS, I sucessfully interviewed to work for Ericsson over 3 months as a summer intern.  
      I gained invaluable experience working with a team within the software industry and was exposed to Agile & Scrum for the first time.
      It was a daunting experience at times but it certainly propelled me forward and gave me a great insight into the industry. 
      I was able to take a lot of what I learned and use it in my 2nd year studies, especially in the group project where I could pass on my knowledge to my fellow classmates.

    <H3>Hotel Management</H3>
<br>
<div> 
  I have 15 years experience working in hotels as a manager, from duty management to deputy general manager.  I believe that the skills I learned during this time 
  will be highly transferable to my software career and help me to adjust to any team I work with.
  I am a very outgoing, people person and my leadership experience really helps me in group situations.
